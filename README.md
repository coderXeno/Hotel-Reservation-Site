> Each room has its own different page and properties

Some of the methods and techniques used in this project are:-
> .map() 
> .filter()
> lifecycle method- componentDidMount()
> setting, changing and updating state
> using props to perform various functions


Notes:-

> lifecycle methods - https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class
  
  Each and every React component has a lifecycle that can be controlled and changed during the 3 fundamental 
  phases of its operation: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting. 
  > Mounting involves inserting elements into the DOM(Document Object Model).
  > After Mounting comes the Updating phase, where a component is updated whenever there
    is a change in its props or state.
  > Lastly comes the Unmounting phase, when the fuction of the component has been served and it 
    removes itself from the DOM
    
> .map() - The .map() method allows the programmer to loop through the items of an array and perform some
           function simultaneously.
           
> .filter() - The .filter() method allows the programmer to map through the array according to a certain
              preset condition and filtering out all the elements of the array that meet that condition.
